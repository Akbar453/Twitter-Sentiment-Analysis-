## Title 
Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview 
This project analyzes Twitter data of about nearly 1.6 million tweets to determine public sentiment regarding specific topics using machine learning techniques.

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to evaluate public sentiment on various topics by analyzing tweet data, enabling businesses and researchers to understand public opinion trends.

## Data Sources
Data is collected using Kaggle , focusing on tweets containing specific keywords or hashtags relevant to the analysis.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF for converting text to numerical features.
Model Training: Applying models such as Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression to classify sentiment.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% in classifying tweet sentiments, demonstrating effectiveness in identifying public opinion trends.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Setup:** Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Run the Code:** Execute `python analyze_sentiment.py` to start the analysis.

3. ## Code Example

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Example code for model training
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data)
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
